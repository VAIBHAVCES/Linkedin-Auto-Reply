# Linkedin Comments Auto Reply

A problem I was in lately, I posted my job update on Linkedin and received a lot of comments from my network congratulating me. One could simply just like all the comments but I personally like to reply to everyone.
Here's what I did. I used selenium to automate replying to comments. 

## Install libraries

1) Selenium : `pip install selenium `

## Chrome Driver

1) Install the latest version of Chrome Driver:http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
2) Set up the path of Chrome Driver in the code

## Running the code

1) You require jupyter notebook to run the ipynb file.
2) Setup Chrome driver
3) Rest of the instructions are in the comments.
